Today's repository contains two input files.

* `input.txt` -- this is the input file provided by the AoC website for the puzzle.
* `benchmark-input.txt` -- this is an input file consisting of 4mb of text with no start-of-packet or start-of-message markers, followed by the actual puzzle input. This file is intended to be used to benchmark different solutions against each other.
