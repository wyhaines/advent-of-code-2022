# advent-of-code-2022

This repository contains my Advent of Code solutions for 2022. I am doing them in Ruby, Crystal, and Rust, and as I release each day, I will be publishing a blog post discussing that day's solution, and how the implementations vary between the three languages. The README for each day will point back to the article discussing the solution for that day, as well.

If you have any questions about these solutions, or why I solved something in a given way, feel free to post an issue in this repo, or email me at wyhaines@gmail.com.
